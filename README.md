 ## Inspiration
We wanted to work with hardware so we grabbed a bunch of different hardware and experimented with different possibilities. The MUSE offered a unique perspective into potential projects involving brain waves and we wanted to delve deeper within the data.

## What it does
Our program uses Processing and the MUSE headset to convert brain waves into musical notes. In addition, visuals in our program correspond to the frequency of the brain waves and are incorporated into the art visuals.

## How we built it
Blood, sweat, tears, and hours and hours of debugging.

## Challenges we ran into
One challenge we ran into was interpreting data and understanding how to communicate with the hardware. We also had problems with figuring out which libraries that interacted with the hardware in Processing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of figuring out how to set up an OSC server. We also were extremely proud of being able to interpret brain frequencies to create an interesting melody and being able to create a visual that interacted with the data.

## What we learned
We learned more about OSC, Processing, neurology, and music theory.

## What's next for Brain Muse
We would like to continue to improve visuals, audio, and the detection of the brain waves. For our visuals, we want to implement a day and night cycle to highlight the low and high tides. Using newer models of the MUSE headset can provide us with more accuracy and flexibility when designing and improving this project. We understand that the newer models of the MUSE can monitor heart rate, breathing, etc. and we hope to be able to use some of these features in our project.
